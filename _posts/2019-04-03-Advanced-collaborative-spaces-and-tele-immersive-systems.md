In the MCT elective course 'Sonification and Sound Design' curated by Anna Xambó we got exposed to many different approaches 
within the context of the sonification field from arts and sciences. Thereby sound has various functions, in science for example revealing 
patterns that are outside our usual awareness sphere and visually difficult to 'grasp'. But sound also serves and acts in artistic auditory 
displays which are can be unexpected and playful. Until now all lecturers were in that sense remarkably innovative and visionary. 

### The art of science or the science in art
I was facilitating the talk of Leif Arne Rønningen, our second guest lecturer, a professor emeritus from the department of telematics NTNU 
(today the department of information security and communication technology). Not only is he drawing knowledge from academia but he also held 
several job positions. Leif introduced us to 'Advanced Collaboration Spaces, requirements and possible realisations' and to the 
'Nidarø Sulpture', a dynamic vision and audio sculpture. Both approaches contain his main research areas on tele-immersive collaboration 
systems and low latency networks. While the Nidarøs Sculpture is an architectural all encompassing concept that is presented in a artistic 
manner including the sonification of the means of presentation, a short clip, the scientific models on collaborative systems are clearly 
engineering 'hands-on' remarks.

Leif Arne's ideas on how to design and engineer these tele-immersive systems are stunningly practical and 
advanced elaborations with the consequence that he is usually at least 20 years ahead, mostly even more. For our work and research on the 
portal this post must be have been much longer to cover and explain a little bit but  we will keep it for another time and going to mainly 
extract his methods of sonification.


### Generating sound from vision, method of sonification 
The sonification process generated sounds from changes in the image in the short demo-clip on the Nidarø sculpture. 
Changes in a sequence of video images can be temporal or spatial sounds, he chose to map the sequences are inspired by an opera, 
three music instruments are used for melody, chord and drums. To reduce processing Leif measured a subset of pixels. From those in RGB 
format he draw six different variables. The input from the image frames was mapped to operational if-then rules to receive numbers, the 
changes in the intensity measured for a selected set of pixels from one image frame to the next.

### Questions, answers and reflections
The Q&A's from the students though were mainly addressed to his visions and ideas of tele-immersive systems and how distant they are 
from now, in years. One question was if mixed reality and collaborative spaces are competing in some way, but Leif stresses their 
complementary role towards each other. One of the applied examples of them is  the concept of the travel bureau: 
Beside the near-natural-virtual communication environment through a multi-view perspective on the landscape and happenings of the 
touristic event, it would of course also include a corresponding soundscape. Technically seen most of Leif Arne's approaches are already 
possible, but just expensive on a mass scale. External factors might accelerate the research when it comes to travelling, the days in 
which these 'vacation scenarios' becoming real are not that far away.
