In the MCT elective course 'Sonification and Sound Design' curated by Anna Xambó we got exposed to many different approaches 
within the context of the sonification field from arts and sciences. Thereby sound has various functions, in science for example revealing 
patterns that are outside our usual awareness sphere and visually difficult to 'grasp'. But sound also serves and acts in artistic auditory 
displays which can be unexpected and playful. Until now all lecturers were in that sense remarkably innovative and visionary. 

### The art of science or the science in art
I was facilitating the talk of Leif Arne Rønningen, our second guest lecturer, a professor emeritus from the department of telematics NTNU 
(today the department of information security and communication technology). Not only is he drawing knowledge from academia but he also held 
several job positions. Leif introduced us to 'Advanced Collaboration Spaces, requirements and possible realisations' and to the 
'Nidarø Sulpture', a dynamic vision and audio sculpture in which he examplified a sonification tool. Both approaches contain his main research areas on tele-immersive collaboration systems and low latency networks. While the Nidarøs Sculpture is an architectural all encompassing concept that is presented in a artistic manner including the sonification of the means of presentation, a short clip, the scientific models on collaborative systems are clearly engineering 'hands-on' illustrations.

Leif Arne's ideas on how to design and engineer these tele-immersive systems are stunningly practical and 
advanced, with the consequence that he is usually at least 20 years ahead of the current practice. For our work and research in the 
portal this article must be have been much longer to convey those concepts, we will keep it for another time. 

### Generating sound from vision, method of sonification 
The sonification process Leif chose was generated from changes in the image in the short demo-clip on the Nidarø sculpture. Up to that time point we have not come across that method in the course. He explains how changes in a sequence of video images can be temporal or spatial. The sounds he mapped to the sequences are inspired by an opera, three music instruments are used for melody, chord and drums. To reduce processing which as explained is very heavy in this undertaking, Leif focussed to measure a subset of pixels. The changes in the intensity measured for the selected set of pixels from one image frame to the next he then was drawing different variables from those in a RGB 
format. The input from the image frames was then mapped to operational if-then rules.

### Questions, answers and reflections
The Q&A's from the students though were mainly addressed to his visions and ideas of tele-immersive systems and how distant they are 
from now, in years. One question was if mixed reality and collaborative spaces would then compete in some way, but Leif stresses their 
complementary role towards each other. It is about studying and finding the connecting dots, a collaboration of different systems and approaches. Another questions was addressed to one of the applied examples of these so called 'multi-view-architectures', it is the concept of the travel bureau: Beside the near-natural-virtual communication environment through a multi-view perspective on the landscape and  sensoral integration into the happenings of an touristic event, it would of course also include a corresponding soundscape. Technically seen most of Leif Arne's approaches are already possible, but some of them are still too expensive for a mass market. External factors could eventually accelerate research, and the days when these "vacation scenarios" become real are most likely closer than we think and want.
