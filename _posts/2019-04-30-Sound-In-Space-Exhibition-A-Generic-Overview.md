Marking the final event before Easter and from our Sonification and Sound design course I was tasked to visit the group exhibition 
'Sound in Space' that took place on the 11th of April at [Gallery KIT, Trondheim](https://www.kit.ntnu.no/en/gallery). It was also the closing event for the sound art course 
in which music-technology and fine art academy students (NTNU) could participate. Beside the exhibition there have been also screenings, 
concerts and happenings. Among the performers were Ellen Lindqvist, Jeremy Welsh, Tijs Ham/Craig, Øyvind Brandsegg and Michael Duch. 
It was a a nice afternoon with many events  going on and things to explore, however I will introduce just one or two installations that 
were created under the umbrella of 'sonification and interactivity'. 


### Playful sonification: Interactive and complicit

Beforehand all students had a short workshop on physical computing. Within a few days they prepared different interactive installations. 
Some participants had never seen an Arduino before nor had any programming experience. Others collected everything they had been doing so 
far into their work as Øyvind Brandsegg and Daniel Formo told me (teachers). The first part of the sound art course would work with field 
recordings, composing stories in sound with environmental sounds. Which would go hand in hand with the digital composition course, 
having audio processing techniques and algorithmic composition. With arduino again they could quickly protoype their ideas. The sonification process again should reveal itself through a creative 
access and control of the installation pieces with sensors or other activation tools.

“This shift from reception-based to performance-based experience brings new challenges 
to sound design and sonification practices.”(Hermann, Hunt, Neuhoff)

Most of the items in the sound art exhibition were indeed so designed that the visitors could directly 
engage with the interactive installations. The talking fox above in the first figure was made by Mina, a 
student from the fine art academy. A proximity sensor established the interactive part, when approaching 
to the fox he would start talking to you and the closer you get the more distinct the sample would get. 
Too bad I couldn't get a hold of her so she could have might explained to me what the fox was actually preaching.


What is sound art though? There is no specific definition out there since it is produced by 
different actors from different disciplines like visual art, composition, sculpturing just to name a few. 
With digital technology sound art has undergone transformations, especially through the low threshold accessibility of sound tools. 
Often features overlap with 'electronic art' e.g the use of technology. Like a visual artwork sound art has no specified timeline; 
it can be experienced over a long or short period of time, without missing the beginning, middle or end (Alan Licht), as sound 
is visceral and emotive it can define a space at the same time as it triggers a memory (Susan Philipsz).


One of the students I met there was Joel (MuTek). Joel's 'Do you remember' (see below) actually plays with that sense of memory and space in a very practical way. 
He collected speech in news reports from the worst natural disasters world wide in the last 6 years. 
On a world map one could see six circles in different regions, when pushing one of them a voice would interrupt randomly the news-reports 
saying, 'do you remember'?

The idea he explains evolved from thinking about an interactive method to recall weather reports but gradually 
moved into some other sort of information transmission.'I just wanted some kind of interface that wouldn't be that technical, basically it 
is just a paper with rings on it and I liked that. Together with the noise cancelling headphones I wanted to create an intimate moment 
within the noisy environment where one could get more introverted as the reports are getting quite close to you.' The rings on the paper 
lying on top of 6 pressure sensors which are connected to an Arduino board. The Arduino sends messages to Max/Msp if a sensor gets 
pressed which then triggers the radio samples. Joel had some programming experience from the first semester in Max/Msp but most 
of the workshop days he spent learning how the Arduino works.

A pressure sensor for LFO grain modulation and a little duck. Live demo soon here.


It seems to be a good practice to explore sonification through physical computing. 
Creating an instrument that works with playful and interactive features seems like 
a rewarding and fun way to learn and access the subject.
