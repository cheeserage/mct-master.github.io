Im a musician and sound technologist from [Kongsberg, Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongsberg). I started off as a **drummer** but gradually got more interested in various music and media technologies after high school. Prior to this degree i´ve studied **jazz drumming**, **live electronics**, **musicology**, **sonology** and **sound design** in both Norway and Australia. Apart from university and working part time as a **technical supervisor at an arts/comedy stage** in Oslo, I like to play with my bands, watch russian movies, read books and climb plastic mountains at the gym.

### Antoine Hureau

I'm a french **composer**, **sound designer** and **art technology consultant** based in [Bergen, Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen). I used to be a **choir singer** when is was younger but I dropped any kind of acoustic instrumental practice to focus on **live and studio electronics**, putting emphasis on **spatial audio** and **acousmatic composing**, I'm very much into audio networks as well. I like to work on my own synths when I have a bit of time and I compose and work with other artists on several kind of **collaborative projects** (ensembles, installations, soundtracks). I also **work at the university of Bergen** as an AV technician in the art, music and design department.

### Paul Koenig

Back when the earth was still cooling and mobile phones had not yet coalesced from the analog mist, I received a degree in **Music Composition** from the University of North Texas. After running away for a bit (i.e., several decades) from music as a career, I finally ran out of options and have made my living for the past ten years as an Arizona-based **songwriter and performer**, touring all over the U.S. and eating a lot of ramen, both literally and figuratively. 

Being both frightened and mildly aroused by the beeps and boops of digital things, and with a philosophical interest in the concept of **Technological Humanism**, I enrolled in the MCT program in an attempt to move from tech voyeurism (I like to watch other people do it) to a more handsy approach. 

In the meantime, I love to **manually manipulate acoustically-vibrating media** and bellow my compositions into a microphone, performing as a **one-man-band** under the nom de guerre PK Gregory. 

I also love cooking, long walks on the beach, and soup. I have a wife (Erin) and two kids (River, 12; Zevon, 4) who are still unsure of what just happened but are going with the flow for the moment.

### Tom Ignatius

I'm a **Record Producer** with specialisation in **Vocal Production** and **Recording** from [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore). Studied in Liverpool, United Kingdom. I play a lot of instruments and with most of them at a horrible level. I have worked on **music featured on Top Gear** and **the Grand Tour** and I am obsessed with pushing the limits of **sound design** and the limits of **recording techniques**. I still work with musicians from all over the world and I'm head of sound with the company **Andsoforth**.


### Thomas Anda

I´m a **guitarist**, **composer** and **educator** who originates from [the west coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skudeneshavn) of Norway. I have a broad range of interest fields, and as a consequence of that, I have a somewhat diverse academic background. I´ve studied **music performance**, **social studies**, **business**, **musicology** and **songwriting & production**. When I´m not studying I work with music-related stuff, play music with my friends, eat panang gai and binge-watch sports documentaries.
