# Hello from the B-Team!

### Jackson

I grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, moved to Los Angeles where I received an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science.  Most of my free time has been continually filled with guitar, digital environments, and eventually a desire to begin creating through these mediums. My interests lay across the board, in novel applications of technology in reaching a better understanding of ourselves and within the musical experience. I hope MCT will be able to both expand my knowledge of these intersections as well as offer a chance to develop within them.

### Magda

I’m Polish, acoustic engineer by education, travel- and radio-lover by choice. After graduating from the first degree I took a “gap year” which ended up lasting for 2,5 years. During this time I lived in Lisbon, Portugal, Ireland and Budapest, Hungary. I’ve spent many years working in the radio as both broadcaster, producer and an assistant by the side of bigger Polish radio personalities.

### Simon

I am from Molde, Norway and have been in Trondheim for about 5 years now. I did my bachelors in Music Technology there. Prior to that i studied Art History for a year and spent a year in Kristiansand where i studied Music. I make some electronic music, and i highly enjoy sound design. I have a little bit of experience here and there from my background in music technology. 

### Jarle

I was born in Oslo 1976, raised in Iceland, Kenya, and Switzerland, and found an interest in sound and music at an early age. After a short but explosive career as a (failed) rock-star I settled into a career in live-sound engineering - with a firm focus on expressions of experimental music. Through the MCT-program I endeavour to develop a user friendly interface democratizing microtonal MIDI. I also like kittens.

## Our group

Our group spans across Norway, Poland and the United States with a wealth of experience between us. We are excited about the prospects of the new ideas and techniques we will be introduced to, along with the ways each of us might be able to fill in the gaps of each other’s knowledge. Our backgrounds include live audio engineering, radio broadcasting, artificial intelligence, and art history. 


### _WE ARE VERY **VERY** FUNNY_
