# MCT4015 Entrepreneurship - Group B

For this class, we were divided into cross-campus groups and presented with a
“problem” to solve via entrepreneurial methods learned through readings, class
discussions, and presentations made by real-world entrepreneurs.

Group B consisted of Magda and Ulrik in Trondheim, and Gaute and Paul in Oslo.

## The problem

> Audio tape recordings suffer magnetic distortion and material deterioration

After initial discussions on what seems on the surface to be a rather bland and
uninspiring problem to tackle (at first glance it seems like a problem for which solutions
are obvious, and already exist), we set to work, researching independently and together,
various possible areas where this problem might exist and possible entrepreneurial
angles to exploit in coming up with a solution. Using tools we learned in class like the
Action Log and Learning Diary to document our research, we would then get together
as a group via Zoom to discuss strategy and brainstorm new ideas.

Putting into practice entrepreneurial models derived from Sarasvathy’s theory of
Effectuation (Causation and Effectuation: Toward a Theoretical Shift from Economic
Inevitability to Entrepreneurial Contingency, Sarasvathy 2001) we eventually narrowed
down an appealing market and product that we all agreed on.

## Solution - the Andvarì

The Andvarì is a temperature and humidity-controlled storage unit for magnetic audio
tape reels. It provides security, storage and peace of mind for the high-end reel-to-reel
tape aficionado as an all-in storage and indexing system for their prized (and very
expensive) tape reels. Designed and manufactured from the ground up in Norway with
no expense spared, it should appeal to the targeted luxury audio segment for whom
quality is paramount, and cost is no barrier.

Named after a dwarf from Norse mythology who guarded a golden treasure of
inestimable value, the Andvarì, with a perfect blend of Nordic design, high technology,
and impeccable workmanship will fit seamlessly into any audiophile’s dream system.
