# Flowcharts 

A rigid signal flowchart is an absolute must in any complex system. These charts help us to systemize, organize and streamline our interactions with the system. Ideally, in our case, a detailed flowchart will help us to spend less time setting up the portal before class and enable more students to orient, use and explore the MCT portal.

# MCT portal

In our quest for the perfect chart, we agreed that detailed connenction specifications and good design is key. Therefore, we decided to center the flowchart around the Midas mixer and LoLa pc, since these two machines serve as the central hub of our system.

Following Anders Tveit's recommendation, we used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com), an application which allows people to collaborate on building flowcharts online. After making a draft, Paul Koening printed out the chart and took it to class. This way, we could inspect and explore the portal first hand while writing down the connection specifications. This process led to further dialog and more discoveries which in turn led to editing, and finally the final chart seen below.

All the objects in the chart have inputs on the bottom and and outputs on the top. The philosophy behind the object coloring is fairly arbitrary but it tries to descriminate between more "active" machines (yellow), "passive" machines (green), output oriented machines (green) and input oriented machines (orange).

The connection wires' shape and color also have meaning. The shape determines what type of signal passes through the wire, and the different colors indicate some signal chain examples, for instance the path in which audio from Trondheim takes before it enters our ears here in Oslo. 

# Lola and Midas 

Furthermore, to able to fully understand our technical system, I felt it necessary to make another chart soley focusing on the relationship between the Midas mixer and the LoLa pc with the RME soundcard. The routing and interplay between these two machines is often the source of trouble in the portal, and is therefore in need of further elaboration.

# Summary

We hope that these flowcharts can be used as manuals for setting up a default MCT portal rig, troubleshooting, as well as serve other educational purposes in our cross campus classroom. We also hope that our charts can help future MCT students become comfortable with the portal and inspire them to update the system in various ways.
