The main concept for the Alien Hamster ball is an instrument expressed through a 3D space. The movement of the sphere will trigger the modulation of the tone, with a sound that is space age or “alien”. Other functions create further options and depth to the model, and allow further exploration through the timbres created.



## Inspiration

It is directly inspired by the alien reece project i produced last year. It is a web based audio model that had oscillators mapped to the mouse movement, on both X and Y axis. I found it refreshingly intuitive to find various clashing and morphing frequencies as you move around the page. This felt very different to adjusting frequencies on a regular synthesiser, and encouraged creating abstract tones and sweeps. 
I wanted to translate this idea to a movement in a 3D space with a physical object.

Also to a lesser extent i was inspired by a group project presented in the first year exploring the use of feedback in a collaborative instrument, and wanted to combine these elements to create a wholly new one.

Here are some concepts when regarding designing a digital music instrument, that the hamsterball hopes to be. 

“Instant music, subtlety later” . As newcomers grow to more expert levels, the music gets more varied and interesting if they experiment with the relative pressures and tilts. 

The “Smart instruments are often not smart” principle, in that the instrument doesn’t change at all, but rather trains the user to use more gentle and subtle manipulations of the sensors. 

And of course - “Everyday objects suggest amusing controllers.”

I used three types of sensor - Accelerometer, microphone and 3 potentiometers. 

The accelerometer adjusts parameters that make up the main body of the instrument.

The mic adds another audio input that adds elements of feedback and unpredictability.

Potentiometers are for adjustments of other basic functions and FX, for expression and shaping.

My pure Data patch has three oscillators as the sound source - split into Osc1, Osc2 and Sub Osc. it also has a microphone as a secondary input source. To add spice and complexity to the timbre, a FM oscillator is fed into Osc 2.
