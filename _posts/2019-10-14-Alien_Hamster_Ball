The main concept for the Alien Hamster ball is an instrument expressed through a 3D space. The movement of the sphere will trigger the modulation of the tone, with a sound that is space age or “alien”. Other functions create further options and depth to the model, and allow further exploration through the timbres created.



## Inspiration

It is directly inspired by the alien reece project i produced last year. It is a web based audio model that had oscillators mapped to the mouse movement, on both X and Y axis. I found it refreshingly intuitive to find various clashing and morphing frequencies as you move around the page. This felt very different to adjusting frequencies on a regular synthesiser, and encouraged creating abstract tones and sweeps. 
I wanted to translate this idea to a movement in a 3D space with a physical object.

Also to a lesser extent i was inspired by a group project presented in the first year exploring the use of feedback in a collaborative instrument, and wanted to combine these elements to create a wholly new one.
