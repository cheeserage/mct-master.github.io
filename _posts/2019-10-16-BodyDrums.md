## Body Drums 
For the course MCT4045 - Interactive Music Systems, I built a wearable drumset.
The wearable drumset consists of a piezo-element placed on one hand, a force-sensing resistor on the other and a accelerometer on the fot. These sensors are then connected to Bela, with processing and playback of audio files in C++. These sensors trigger one file each. In my case I used a kick drum sound for the foot, snare drum sound for the piezo element and a hi hat sound for the FSR. Voil√†, I got a wearable drumset.
