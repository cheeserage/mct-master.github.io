## Body Drums 
For the course MCT4045 - Interactive Music Systems I decided to build a wearable drumset.
By placing a piezo-element on one hand, a force-sensing resistor on the other and a accelerometer on the fot connected to Bela with processing and playback of audio files in C++, you suddenly have a wearable trigger-system. These sensors trigger one file each. In my case I used a kick drum sound for the foot, snare drum sound for the piezo element and a hi hat sound for the FSR. Voil√†, I got a wearable drumset.
