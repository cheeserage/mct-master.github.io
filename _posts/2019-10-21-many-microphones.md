We've spent a few days (in addition to the many miscellanous hours during class) reconfiguring the Portal and testing out new hardware and how it might improve the quality of our sound. Here are a list of microphones we were able to test over the MCT 4021 class. This list will likely be updated with any new mics we test and other miscellaneous notes we find about our experiences streaming with them.

### Microphone criteria

These criteria were loosely based around these qualities of a microphone and their general usability during class and for performances we may have to setup. Maintaining this balance that allows us to keep quick access to the default classroom model.

- sensitivity of mic
- power needed to drive
- dynamic range
- quality
- noise floor - high pitch whine? on Trondhiem - size and usability/practicality - sound texture (perceptual)
- pattern control
- position, static
- directionality

### MD421 (in Oslo)

<img src="/assets/image/portal/md421.jpg" width = "30%">
</figure>

	• needs more gain
	• less sensitive
	• no room sound
	• dry
	• distance is the same
	• generally a little better

### SM7b (in Trondheim)

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/sm7b.jpg" width = "30%">
</figure>

    • dryer
    • more low end
    • fuller spectrum
    • less tinny
    • sounds like a vocal booth
    • you would need to be in close proximity
    	○ not as practical space wise
    • better than the MD421

### Sennheiser 835 (in Oslo)

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/s835.jpg" width = "30%">
</figure>

    • drier
    • direct, less room
    • not as distinguishable
    • weakest

### Ceiling mic (in Trondheim)

    • too low
    • very poor sound quality
    • unusable

### Boundary mic (in Trondheim)

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/boundary_mic.jpg" width = "30%">
</figure>

    • space wise, very little clutter
    • but room sound is apparent
    • table noise
    • muddy

### Shotgun mic (in Trondheim)

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/shotgun_mic.jpg" width = "30%"/>
</figure>

    • clear and collected
    • directional
    • can be used at quite a distance and from overhead
    • can still hear the reverb from other side
    • may be able to cover a large space (would only need two?)

### AT AE5100 (X/Y Stereo) (in Oslo)

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/ae5100.jpg" width = "30%"/>
</figure>

    • clear and transparent
    • less muddy
    • less room sound
    • thinner?
    • more natural?
    • visually obstrusive

### Overhead mic

<figure>
<img src="/assets/image/portal/biamp.jpg" width = "30%">
</figure>

    • good spatialization
    • no reverb
    • little whiney (high end)
