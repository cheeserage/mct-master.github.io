## Introduction

Music and body motion are strongly interconnected.As a drummer, I always feel strongly connected to the music with my motion in a performance and I am fascinated by how a genre or the type of music influences the body movements. During the studies in Music, Communication and Technology study program, I had the opportunity to actively participate in the Norwegian Championship for Standstill competition in 2019 and grasp the methods of the whole process starting from setting up the Motion Capture system to choosing the final winner of the competition. The MoCap system outputs a rich continuous data stream with a larger number of data points and my motivation behind the thesis was to combine this data stream with sound to hear the participants’ movements. Moreover, this implementation can be used as an instrument for a “Standstill performance” and opens a new door for a sonic interaction space with human micromotion.
