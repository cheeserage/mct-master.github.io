# Multimedia Slideshow Maker

## Intro

During my master's thesis, I have designed and developed a prototype tech platform where a mobile application automatically creates slideshows from multimedia content uploaded in a web application titled “Multimedia Slideshow Maker” (MSM). The project is carried out for an external partner, Alight AS, for a project called Alight. Alight is a mobile tech platform aiding caregivers in sending personalised video sessions to patients with dementia. The project aims to determine to what degree the MSM can be used independently by a caregiver, without instructions from others or prior experience in video editing.

The MSM was designed and developed in iterations based on feedback from experienced evaluators and tested with end-users. The test results showed several usability problems, and potential solutions to each problem are discussed. The system has been compared to similar applications, where both strengths and limitations of the MSM were discovered. Still, with its limitations, participants were to a large extent able to use the MSM independently, without instructions from others, letting them create a multimedia slideshow without requiring experience in video editing.

## Background

The number of people in Norway and the rest of the world with dementia is increasing every year. Dementia is an incurable disease and does not only affect people with dementia but also their caregivers, families and the entire society. Music and reminiscence therapy has been used to improve the quality of life for people with dementia and their caregivers. As the number of people with dementia is rising, we need to be able to provide care in the patients’ own homes and be able to care for more people at once.

A company called Alight AS is working on a project called Alight. Alight is currently a mobile tech platform for healthcare workers at nursing homes and the home healthcare service. The platform is connecting the healthcare worker to a patient, aiding and sending personalised video sessions to patients with mild to moderate dementia. These so-called "personalised video sessions" are developed with the intention of providing music and reminiscence therapy in a mobile solution, where the structure and content of a video session consist of:

- Personalised image slideshow with personalised music
- Video of the healthcare worker (excercise, live playing, breathing exercise etc.), or other personalised videos.

In the current state of Alight, the video sessions are manually made by employees at Alight. Moving forward, Alight's vision is to let any caretaker use the tech platform independently to care for people with mild to moderate dementia. A caretaker can be a therapist, home nurse, familiy friend, anyone with close relations to a person with dementia.

## The purpose of the thesis

To help with Alight's vision, this project has involved the creation of a system that automatically creates multimedia slideshows (video sessions) from content uploaded by a caregiver in a web app titled Multimedia Slideshow Maker (MSM). A caregiver can be just about anyone; old, young, tech-savvy, inexperieced in using web apps, with potentially no experience in video editing. This meant that the system had to be designed for a high degree of usability, and making the system itself do most of the editing. The aim was then to determine to what degree the MSM can be used independently by a caregiver, without instructions from others or prior experience in video editing.

# Music and reminiscence theory

“Music therapy is recognized as an established health profession that uses music to facilitate therapeutic processes. Even without a professional music therapist, many patients and clinicians listen to or play music to manage stress, anxiety, and pain in clinical settings.” (Kemper & Danhauer, 2005, p. 283).

Tone Sæther Kvamme (2008) argues that music therapy is a vital necessity for people with dementia. that music can give people with dementia access to feelings, help them express themselves, awake memories, strengthen their identity, and also give a sense of achievement and affiliation. Even Ruud (2008) argues that the experience of music and how it affects us depends on our musical background, influence, our choice of music, and the situation we are in while experiencing the music.

“Reminiscence therapy involves the discussion of memories and past experiences with other people using tangible prompts such as photographs or music to evoke memories and stimulate conversation” (Woods et al., 2018, p. 1).

A systematic review by Istvandity (2017) found positive effects in combining music and reminiscence therapy, with effects on the mental well-being of people with dementia, especially stress, anxiety and depression. The study could not determine what is a successful delivery of the combination of music and reminiscence therapy.

The research shows benefits of using both music and reminiscence therapy for the purpose of improving the quality of life for patients with dementia, but there is less knowledge of how these therapies should be delivered to be successful. It would be interesting to investigate the effects of music and reminiscence therapy delivered by any caregiver through a mobile app, but that is beyond the scope of this project.

# The system

The system consists of a web app (MSM) and a mobile app. These platforms are connected through a backend service called Firebase. The intention is that a caregiver will upload content (images, music and video) in the MSM and then send it to an account belonging to the person with dementia. The person with dementia can then sign in to the mobile app and view the multimedia slideshow that is created in real-time in the app. Currently, the system connects the content that is uploaded to the same account, letting the caregiver preview the multimedia slideshow when signing in to the app. Letting the caregiver send the content to another account will be implemented when it potentially will be integrated with the platform of Alight.

## The MSM

The MSM was developed with JavaScript, using a library called React and a backend service called Firebase. React was used to build the user interface, making functionalities for uploading content (music, images and video), and for letting the user rearrange the images to their choosing. Firebase was used as a service for authentication (login), database (metadata) and storage (multimedia content).

## The mobile app

The mobile app was made to both create and present a multimedia slideshow in real-time. The reason for making the mobile app do this, was that the intention is to include a music streaming service at a later stage. When a caregiver has to choose music to be consumed by another person it can quickly become a problem with sharing what may often be copyrighted material. Using a music streaming service can deal with this problem.

The mobile was developed using a cross-platform development tool called Flutter. Cross-platform means that I could write code that works for both Android and IOS, making the development both easier and faster. Flutter is quite a new tool, with the first stable version released in december 2018. As with many new products, bugs can be encountered, and of course I did. A day of work could go by, trying to solve a bug. With the help of Even Brenna, an experience developer at Alight AS, and a strong community of developers at Stackoverflow, it was possible to fix and proceed.

The functionality of making a multimedia slideshow was developed wuth the help of three awesome libraries:

- Carousel slider - For making a slideshow of images
- Just-audio - For playing audio
- Chewie - For playing a video

The programming language of Flutter is called Dart. This was used to handle fetching of data from Firebase, to add images to cache memory, and to schedule all events, making it look something like this:

## Designing the user interface with high degree of usability

“Usability is most often defined as the ease of use and acceptability of a system for a particular class of users carrying out specific tasks in a specific environment” (Holzinger, 2005, p. 71).

The biggest part of the project was to develop a user interface with a high degree of usability. This was acieved through the use of two methods. The first method is called Heuristic evaluation (HE), a method from what Holzinger (2005) descibres as User Inspection Methods. HE involves usability specialists judging the system, providing feedback to wheter the system follows established usability principles or not. I used some popular usability principles called Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, which are:

1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

I had a total of four design iterations where I recieved feedback from people with experience in user interaction, constantly improving the MSM based on the feedback recieved.

It went from looking like this:
