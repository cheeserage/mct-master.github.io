## Portal Jam 23 January 2019, Documentation from Oslo Team


On the 23 of January, we were testing out to jam together through the Portal. We had a meeting on 21 January to make a plan for the jam. We suggested that we should minimize the amount of instruments, and focus on bass & guitar in Trondheim and drums & vocal in Oslo. We also had a technical team, and we documented the jam by recording it with video and audio.

We chose to use multitrack Lola for the jam. On 21 January we also chose which song we wanted play during the jam, so that all musicians could be prepared and so that we didn't have to waste time on discussing which songs we wanted to play on the day of the experiment. So we decided on playing the jazz standard "All of Me" by Gerald Marks. 

This is how we delegated the tasks:

#### Oslo side:

Mixing: Ashane

Documentation: Guy & Sam

Drums: Elias

Vocal: Mari.


#### Trondheim side:

Documentation: Karolina

Bass: Eirik

Guitar: Jonas or Sepehr.


### Videos from the performance


In those two videos, you see the Oslo Side of the performance. The Trondheim side of the performance was documented in [this](https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2019/02/10/Documentation-and-recommendations-from-the-latest-Portal-Jam.html) blog post. 

#### The line up (Oslo side):

Saxophone: Guy Sion

Drums: Elias Sukken Andersen

Vocals: Mari Lesteberg

#### Line up (Trondheim side):

Bass: Eirik Dahl

Guitar: Jonas Bjordal

Piano: Daniel Formo

#### Second try, with click:

### Reflections

As you can see and hear in the first video, we very quickly started to decrease in tempo. There is a huge difference in BPM at the beginning and in the end. It's likely that this decrease in tempo happened because of the transmission latency in the LOLA system.

This was why we decided to give it another try, but with click this time, as you can hear in the second video. It helped a lot, but we were still struggling somehow to keep up in sync with the click. For rhytmic music like jazz, it seemes that playing with click is mandatory to be able to keep the time in the telematic performance. However, for the audience, listening to a click track is not very pleasant. An interesting future task could be to figure out a nice soloution to let the performers only hear the click track during a performance (and not the audience).

Another idea for future telematic jam sessions, would be to experiment with different types of music than jazz, with less strict tempo preferences. Maybe more ambient types of music would fit the setting better.
