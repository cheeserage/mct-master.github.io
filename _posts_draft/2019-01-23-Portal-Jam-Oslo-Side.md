## Portal Jam 23 January 2019, Documentation from Oslo Team


On the 23 of January, we were testing out to jam together through the Portal. We had a meeting on 21 January to make a plan for the jam. We suggested that we should minimize the amount of instruments, and focus on bass & guitar in Trondheim and drums & vocal in Oslo. We also had a technical team, and we documented the jam by recording it with video and audio.

We chose to use multitrack Lola for the jam. On 21 January we also chose which song we wanted play during the jam, so that all musicians could be prepared and so that we didn't have to waste time on discussing which songs we wanted to play on the day of the experiment. So we decided on playing the jazz standard "All of Me" by Gerald Marks. 

This is how we delegated the tasks:

#### Oslo side:

Mixing: Ashane

Documentation: Guy & Sam

Drums: Elias

Vocal: Mari.


#### Trondheim side:

Documentation: Karolina

Bass: Eirik

Guitar: Jonas or Sepehr.


#### Video from the performance


In this video, you see the Oslo Side of the performance. The Trondheim side of the performance was documented in [this](https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2019/02/10/Documentation-and-recommendations-from-the-latest-Portal-Jam.html) blog post. 

#### Reflections

As you can see and hear in the video, we very quickly started to decrease in tempo.
