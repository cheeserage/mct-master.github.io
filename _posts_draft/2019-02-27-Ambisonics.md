### Portal workshop on Ambisonics, 27 February 2019

On 27 February 2019, we had a workshop on Ambisonics in the portal course. Anders Tveit gave us a lecture on how to encode and decode sound inputs from Lola, using the AIIRADecoder in Reaper. He talked about different formats, and that we had to convert A format to B format with software. And then convert it to Ambic format.

We learned that you can have as many speakers as you like, but at least 4 speakers. Then we discussed what microphone shape/pattern to use, like omni, heart-shape etc. 

This was the chain flow: Midas mixer - > Computer - > mixer - > Lola - > Speakers

After the lecture, we started to set up the portals with eight speakers, that had to be placed with the right angle relative to each other. In Oslo, we chose not to mount the speakers in the sealing, but to set up a non-permanent with speaker stands instead.

## Challenges about the set-up:

Next time we should clear the floor completely before setting up all the equipment. A Laser meter would also have been useful.
