## Introduction

## System

<a href="https://github.com/MeltingPlanet/SonifiGroupProj" target="_blank">Code repository</a>

## Reflection

---
### What we need to include 

* Concept: originality / creativity
* Design / Implementation: technical choices, engineering, reproducibility
* Artistic / Aesthetics: style, consistency
* Mappings / intelligibility: the elements (or a subset) of the original data are reflected systematically in the resulting sound?
* Delivery: oral communication for the presentation, written communication for the blog post / article

* It should include all of the previous explained in written format and combined with visual material.
* It should also include the code repository and a reflection section from the feedback received during the presentation.
* It should be an ‘online’ shorter version of the article adapted to the online medium (e.g. code snippets, videos, links).
