## Creating a virtal/augumented immersive space with Ambisonics in the Portal

On the 24 of April, we went into groups to solve a task handed out by Anders Tveit. Our task was to create a virtual/augmented immersive pace, using Polycom or Zoom for video and a DAW of any choice together with MIDAS mixer and LOLA for sound. 
We chose to use Ableton Live together with plugins for ambisonics to solve this task.


The task:

Setting up a ambisonic encoding (5th or 3rd order) of microphones decoded to binaural (Headphones and headphone distribution) in the portals.

Create two rooms:

1: A "natural" immersive space.

2: A virtual/augmented immersive space.


Use Polycom and or Zoom for video.
Optional: Add OSC or MIDI control of parameters over the network. (For example corresponding to or counter to spatial movement or placement.)

Technology: LOLA, MIDAS mixer, headphones distributor, Headphones, Laptop, OSC (Open sound control)
Software: Reaper, Max,PD, Webaudio, Ableton Live or any software that accepts ambisonic encoding and binaural decoding.

(For Ableton)

# Discuss and define what constitutes a natural immersive space and in what way can a immersive virtual space be created?

# Plan and create an efficient routing setup between the technology, what type of hardware is needed? what type of cables etc.

# Testing of basic communication and possible musical performance

# Documentation with video and text

# Written reflections and descriptions, consideration of potential scenarios

 

Learning outcomes:

be able to systematically explore, evaluate and document different strategies for audio-visual communication and collaboration.
strategies for  physical-virtual communication, and plan a technical solution of these ideas in the Portal.
