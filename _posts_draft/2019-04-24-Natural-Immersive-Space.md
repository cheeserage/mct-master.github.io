## Creating a natural immersive space with Ambisonics in the Portal

On the 24 of April, Anders Tveit handed us two tasks to solve, one for each of the two groups. The tasks was the following: Set up an ambisonic encoding (5th or 3rd order) of microphones decoded to binaural. One group was supposed to make a "natural" immersive spave and the other group a "virtual/augmented" immersive space. We selected the groups depeding on what we wanted to achieve. Our group (Eigil, Elias, Guy, Ashane and Espen) chose to do the "natural" immersive space.
