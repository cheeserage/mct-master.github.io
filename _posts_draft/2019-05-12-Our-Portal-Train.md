There are many blogs explainig the audio set ups in the <a href="https://mct-master.github.io/" target="_blank">**The blog of MCT**</a>. However, only few of them have addressed the physical setup of furnitures and technical equipments to meet the specific tasks, for example, <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/09/10/A-team-first-week.html" target="_blank">**A-team-First Week**</a>, <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/09/17/Group-B-setting-up-tico.html" target="_blank">**M.A.D.E - setting up Tico**</a> and <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/10/03/A-team-presentation.html" target="_blank">**Group A - Setting up for a joint group presentation**</a>.   
This blog is an attempt to fill the gaps and documents how the portal in Trondhei has been used to facilitate communication in various occasions during the spring semester from January-May, 2019. We had five courses with different teaching and learning environment in the spring semester. Together with lectures and seminars, we had some series of talks, workshops and also started both running and streaming of the WoNomute seminars from the portal.
