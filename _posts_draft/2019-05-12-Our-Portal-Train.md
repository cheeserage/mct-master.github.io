# Scenarios in the Portal in Trondheim, NTNU in the spring semester-2019

## Introduction

There are many blogs in <a href="https://mct-master.github.io/" target="_blank">**The blog of MCT**</a> explainig various technologies and audio set ups that we have been exploring in the portal. However, only few of them have addressed the overall physical layout of the portal with technical equipments using various technologies to meet specific tasks, for example, <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/09/10/A-team-first-week.html" target="_blank">**A-team-First Week**</a>, <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/09/17/Group-B-setting-up-tico.html" target="_blank">**M.A.D.E - setting up Tico**</a> and <a https://mct-master.github.io/portal/2018/10/03/A-team-presentation.html" target="_blank">**Group A - Setting up for a joint group presentation**</a>. While completing one whole year of the **MCT Studies** and spending one semester in the new portal in Trondheim, we have had different scenarios in the portal for different events like lecture, seminar, conference meeting and so on. We also hosted a series of talks, workshops and started both running and streaming of the <a http://wonomute.no/" target="_blank">**WoNomute**</a> from the portal. This blog is an attempt to fill the gaps and documents how the portal in Trondheim has been used to facilitate different modes of communication in various events during the spring semester from January-May, 2019, highlighting on the physical layout and technical solutions opted during those occasions.

## Logistics & Modes of Communication
We have been working with three display screens for visual solutions in the portal in Trondheim. As shown in Figure 1 below, **Screen 1** is a unit combined with 4 separate screens (each of approx. 140cm x 79 cm) which links with each other and works as a single big screen (approx. 280cm x 157 cm). **Screen 2** is a 50 inch TV mounted on a mobile stand and **Screen 3** is a full length wall finished with special paints for making it a screen suitable for projectors. So far, the physical layout of the portal have been created based upon the choice of these display units. 

Further, we have been using <a http://wonomute.no/" target="_blank">**Zoom**</a> as a primary mode of communication between the two campuses in Trondheim and Oslo. Although it has a bit of issue with latency, it has been working quite well. Moreover, we have been having a stable and uninterrupted connection via zoom all through the semester. There is a dedicated computer which is only used to run the zoom in the portal. In addition to Zoom, we have been using <a https://lola.conts.it/" target="_blank">**LOLA**</a> to transmit the audio between the two campuses. It also has its own dedicated computer which is very powerful than the zoom pc. But most of the times, we are using Zoom only for video conference while LOLA for the audio as the latter delivers a low latency high quality audio solutions. However, we have used ZOOM for both audio and video solutions on few occasioins when LOLA did not work. Among other technologies, we have both TICO and Polycom available for both audio and visual modes of communication. However, we never worked with TICO in this semester and Polycom was just used for some testings couple of times. Besides, for managing the audio signals we have been using the Midas 'm32' mixer. There are ofcourse a lot of other equipments like different types of microphones, cables, cameras, switch boxes and so on and details regarding them have not been covered in this blog.

## Scenario-1 : Lectures / Conference meeting

### Physical Layout

We have tested different seating layouts to hold lectures and meetings in the portal in Trondheim, for example U-shape, V-shape, L-shape and so on. As we were only 7 students here, 8 seats were enough for lectures with one seat for our teacher. The Layout-2 above has an additional feature than the Layout-1. The standing height working table placed in front of the students in Layout-2 gives the teacher an advantage of facing directly towards the students in Trondheim in front and the students in Oslo through the projection on the wall (Screen 3) behind the Trondheim students. Both of the layouts have been used for holding lectures here in Trondheim during the **MCT4048 Audio Programming - Spring 19** course while the Layout-1 has also been used for holding initial monday meetings in the **MCT4022 Physical-virtual communication and music 2 - Spring** course this semester.

### Technical solutions
Layout-1 requires only one camera and it makes it very easy and simple to connect a usb supported camera (in our case the logitech ptz camera) to the zoom pc. All we need to do is open a zoom meeting through the zoom tablet that connects wirelessly to the zoom pc. Then adjust the camera zooming in and out as per preference while waiting for participants to join in. It does not require any other systems for the audio but as we are interested in achieving for one of the best solutions, we are using LOLA instead. We are


## Scenario-2: Lecture, Workshops and Series of Talks from Experts and Professionals

### Physical Layout

We had to try a new set up for hosting a series of talks from experts and processionals in the MCT4046 Sonification and Sound design - Spring 19 course this semester. Layout-3 came out to be perfect because it was also flexible to be used as a scenario for workshop or lecture with a very little re-arrangement. For example, with just unplugging the presenter's laptop and removing the cam-2 gives the Layout-4 which was used for all of the lectures during the MCT4046 course in the semester. In this case, the teacher gave her lectures while seating among the students.

##  Scenario-3: WoNoMute

### Physical Layout

Although all of the scenarios are different from one another, but most of them have only few dissimilarities. In my experience, WoNomute has been one of the most unique scenarios that we have practiced so far. It is an open talk show where the number of audience taking part can go from 20-25 at each end. Perhaps, the portal in Oslo can house a bit more than that. But the most interesting part is, the talk show is streamed live on line. It adds in some kicks to the crew members sometimes because we have seen many strange technical difficulties that make it challenging to do the job.

Right from the beginning of the semester, we have been able to make a more or less stable layout (Layout-5) for hosting the talks. It also involves a bit of physical works on removing all tables out and bringing in enough chairs and vice versa after the end of the talk.
### Technical solutions
WoNomute has been by far, the most challenging scenarios during the entire semester.





## Challenges

However, the core idea of Oslo and Trondheim being extension of one another has not been met. (lecture scenario)

## Acknowledgement
We have been greatly successfull in organizing and re-organizing different scenarios in the portal as per the requirement of the set ups. However, this would not have been possible without the help of our dedicated teachers and all of us üí™üèΩ hard working studentsüòú.
