Pedro Duarte Pestana was the final guest speaker who joined us virtually with his presentation 
'Career Management in Music Technology / Knowledge Engineering in Music Technology and Sonic Arts' from Porto. 
The Sonification seminar series was part of the MCT Spring semester and curated by Anna Xambo and facilitated by Eigil Aandahl.

Pedro Duarte Pestana (Lisbon, 1975) has a background in engineering and worked professionally as an sound engineer and music producer 
for 15 years before entering academia full-time. It is an very interesting challenge to narrow down and introduce
his convoluted path of career and all the project he was and is involved in. They definetely all gravitate around intelligent audio technologies in musical and non-musical context. 
As a researcher and consulter for emerging audio technologies and intelligent systems he is also intertwined with the industry.

Pedro was the first student in Portugal who held a PhD in computer music. He teaches currently at the UCP in Porto 
'interactive sound design'. In one of his 'previous lifes' as a sound engineer he worked with high profile artist such as Bill Fontana, Teresa Salgueiro, Pedro Joia, Mario Laginha among many others. Pedro was mostly known for bringing consistently new and unconventional approaches into the field. 
Mixing actually rather classic-acoustical pieces but also Pop, his mind set was always that of a tinkerer and hacker. 
Frustrated by the iterative processes that came along the profession of an audio engineer like microphone placing, he started to develop 
and research on automated mixing procedures. Pedro would for example built a robot that could position the microphones for him. 
He also designed a multi-touch interface in the 90ties, long time before they were commercially available. Following everything that 
seemed interesting to him between his MSc and PhD, he could gave us pretty precious, multi-perspetive advices for a career in music 
technology and its related fields.

### Cross adaptive processing and automated Mixing systems 
Pedro's vision and that of his colleagues during his PhD studies was to artificially replicate what a human mixing engineer would do. 
An algorithm performs with more ease and makes it respond to different heuristics at a click of a button, so sais Pedro. 
Many aspects of his research sparked wider interest and attracted also the industry. The community and industry around grew quite fast. 

It challenged him to push his research in a certain direction. As a Gulbekian Professor he leads currently Portugal's largest private 
foundation when it comes to research in interactive sound design, driven by audio-content analysis. The novel approach here is that 
interactive sound functions as a social mediator of engagement between human actors. A machine, always equipped with some sort of 
intelligent hearing either acts as an an antagonist or as a 'helper' within human interaction.  

### Sonification of care -  or healthy sonic futures
The research group focused on 3 case studies, all being a generative algorithms as agents of 
facilitation or blockers of everyday interaction between humans. For the context the MCT sonification course there is 
especially one interesting case study among. The use of sound design of aural feedback in live-support machines and EG systems, 
used by wealth care professions. How can the sound be designed in order to informative to care givers and at the same time soothing 
to those in need of help. He calls the system behind the process curated sonification as there is no one to one mapping of features to 
sonic parameters. Apparently most of the studies for this project were undertaken with offline data which poses questions to real-world 
results. However the analysis is still ongoing.

### Questions and answers 
One important questions was tackling audio analytics and how privacy could be sustained? 
Audio analytics are about to enter the internet of things with extra-ordinary precision. Machines around us are listening and will do 
even better. The dynamics of our own environment when nit comes to mood and emotion will become very transparent through our utterances, footsteps and breathing intensity. Predicting future happenings will come with ease and great accuracy. The concept of privacy will alter irreversibly within the next decades.
Another questions gathered around Pedro's elaboration on the academic establishment, the dilemma in academic publishing. 
The common patterns of recognition trouble in academia that led into a situation in which many researchers facing the 
(on the long run economic) pressure of publishing for the sake of being perceived rather than for the contribution of new knowledge. 
Consequently there would be a certain predictability in some areas of research. 

### Reflections
There were so many interesting aspects, from all of them I could extract something for myself. 
I guess the most relevant were from a societal aspect were Pedro's elaboration on audio analytics which I mentioned earlier in the Q&A. 
From a personal aspect and reflecting on academia and the industry it was helpful to learn from  one of the main actors in pushing a novel 
field of academic research that sparked also into the market place. The possibilities that come along emerging technology research, while 
'classical' scientific academic disciplines require ruthlessness to achieve a certain degree of interesting and valuable work, 
a novel area would would act much more forgiving to mistakes.
