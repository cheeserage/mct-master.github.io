## Description: 
The title of our project is "Recycle Orchestra" inspired by the theme of the competition and our approach to solving it, by making individual instruments controlled by recycled materials and "recycling" sound by sampling. 

## Technologies: 
Bela: 
- We all used Bela as our sound source and to receive signals form the various sensors. 

Sensors: 
- Distance sensor to control the lead-voice. 
- Pressure sensor attached to a plastic bottle to control the notes of the bass-synth. 
- Rotary knobs to control the LFO and lo-pass on the bass-synth. 
- Microphone placed in a glass bottle. 
- Buttons to trigger samples. 

Sampling:

## Timeline
In the start, we had a vision of how we wanted the instrumentation of our "band" to look like, but we had no idea of how we were supposed to get there. It was through a creative process of exploring the possibilities of the software, within the limitations of the given theme that we ended up with our final concept. 

[//]: # (Division of labour: Explain who has been working in what, how you have documented it and working strategies.)
## Division of labour:
 As the level of knowledge about Pure Data and Bela greatly varies within the group, we found a natural distribution of the labour as we worked on the project. Being able to use the screen sharing tool in Zoom was priceless in order to build on each others strengths and collaborate on the software. 

[//]: # (Achievements: Give a summary of the achievements of this week through the project. Any progress?)

[//]: # (Whrite what challenges you had here)
## Challenges: 
Our challenges mostly consisted of getting the right inputs in Bela to map to the correct parameters in the PD -patch, within the right values. For instance; getting the pressure sensor to accurately hit the various notes in the bass synth was a challenge due to its very untraditional input method and that it has to start and stop the different oscillators in relation to the pressure applied. 

We had a major challenge with getting one of the PD -patches to work as it should in Bela. Fore some reason the lead synth would not play the same way it did in PD when loading it to Bela, so we were left with a somewhat sub-optimal solution on that part. 

## Performance/reflection: 
[//]: # (How did the performance go? Any surprises? What about the team work strategies within and across campuses?)
The performance went surprisingly well! 
We did not
