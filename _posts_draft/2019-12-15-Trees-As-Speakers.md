# Background

In this project, we collaborated with ÅF Engineering. Martin Hallberg acted as our external supervisor and Stefano Fasciani as the internal supervisor. The goal of the project was to create a non-intrusive soundscape and/or noise-masking installations in an outdoor public space by using trees as speakers, installing audio exciters in the root system of the trees. We got information on a similar project, which has already been done by ÅF Engineering. It is an installation at the Sofiero Park in Helsingborg, Sweden, and the trees play eight different fairy tales. The installation consists of one exciter per tree and people can listen to them by putting their ears on trees. And also we came across another similar project named “Listen Tree” which is a research by MIT Media Lab. It consists of an underground installation of the exciters and self-powered.
We were supposed to investigate the following questions during the project

What kind of tree/wood gives the best resonance?  
How can we mount the transducers in the root system to achieve the best sound output? Do we need one or more transducers to get the best sound quality?  
How far can sounds, emitted by a tree, reach?  
What is the effect (qualitative and quantitative) of having several trees as sound sources close to each other?  
What sound should a tree “play”?  
How should the sound file be mastered so that it can be “played” out of a tree with minimal losses?  
Can sound-emitting trees be used to hide unwanted noise in public spaces?  
How can such systems make noisy public spaces more attractive to people (user surveys, concept design surveys)?  

# Analysis

The initial visualization consists of so many data points that made it impossible for comparison. Then we experimented with different types of smoothing curves of the data and chose 1/6 as the best-applied smoothing. Then we discussed on which recordings to compare and analyse.

# Summary of Analysis
First, we compared the recording of the regular birch tree with one exciter and two exciters. The results showed that Overall the number of Exciters doesn’t seem to affect the frequency response other than the levels.

Next, we wanted to investigate if the number of trees can affect the produced frequency content. From the results, we identified that using one exciter per each tree tends to produce a slight drop in 100 Hz - 380 Hz range.

Next, we analyzed the frequency responses of birch, Spruce and the large birch tree. The results were interesting and led to some ambiguity about the recording itself. According to the graph, the large birch tree is producing lower frequencies in the 100 Hz -200 Hz region. Then we had to reinvestigate if this low end is actually produced by the tree or by the background noise of the recording. The recording had a background noise of rain which was not possible to clean or remove during the editing process because it will drastically affect the frequency response graph.  

Figure 4: Frequency Response - Three types of trees  

As we discussed in the group meeting, we created frequency response graphs of the background noise in the recording by choosing 1-3s clips of the background noise. And also created another frequency response graph by using the half-length sinusoidal sweeps (so the sweeps will start from 500 Hz- This step was for further confirmation that the low end was not produced by any background noise). As the final result, there is strong evidence to prove that the larger birch tree produces more low frequency content.

Figure 5: Noise Floor Analysis  

According to the urban noise analysis we did, higher dB levels of low-frequency content below 100 Hz should be produced from trees to mask public noise. And also by listening and looking at the frequency spectrum, We realized that the noises from vehicles contribute more to the low frequencies in urban noises. We concluded that this kind of system is not suitable for noise masking but more appropriate as sound installations.Trees can be used in office spaces to play background music to break the extreme silence. Also, interactive installations can be done in public parks and children parks. As an example, playing sounds through trees which will trigger if a person gets closer to trees.
