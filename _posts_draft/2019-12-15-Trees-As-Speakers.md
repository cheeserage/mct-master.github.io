# Background

In this project, we collaborated with ÅF Engineering. Martin Hallberg acted as our external supervisor and Stefano Fasciani as the internal supervisor. The goal of the project was to create a non-intrusive soundscape and/or noise-masking installations in an outdoor public space by using trees as speakers, installing audio exciters in the root system of the trees. We got information on a similar project, which has already been done by ÅF Engineering. It is an installation at the Sofiero Park in Helsingborg, Sweden, and the trees play eight different fairy tales. The installation consists of one exciter per tree and people can listen to them by putting their ears on trees. And also we came across another similar project named “Listen Tree” which is a research by MIT Media Lab. It consists of an underground installation of the exciters and self-powered.
We were supposed to investigate the following questions during the project

What kind of tree/wood gives the best resonance?  
How can we mount the transducers in the root system to achieve the best sound output? Do we need one or more transducers to get the best sound quality?  
How far can sounds, emitted by a tree, reach?  
What is the effect (qualitative and quantitative) of having several trees as sound sources close to each other?  
What sound should a tree “play”?  
How should the sound file be mastered so that it can be “played” out of a tree with minimal losses?  
Can sound-emitting trees be used to hide unwanted noise in public spaces?  
How can such systems make noisy public spaces more attractive to people (user surveys, concept design surveys)?  

# Analysis

The initial visualization consists of so many data points that made it impossible for comparison. Then we experimented with different types of smoothing curves of the data and chose 1/6 as the best-applied smoothing. Then we discussed on which recordings to compare and analyse.

# Summary of Analysis
First, we compared the recording of the regular birch tree with one exciter and two exciters. The results showed that Overall the number of Exciters doesn’t seem to affect the frequency response other than the levels.
