## Intro
Building on the experience derived from having concerts in a very controlled environment, such as the portal and the experience we have from photography and live-shows, we have done several streaming concerts to help artists reach their audience during lockdown. Covid19 presented society with a host of challenges, and continuing to have concerts is one of them. We have put together a quick guide for those who want to put together their own streaming-concerts and developed routines and techniques that can be used for concerts in the portal, when the campus opens up.  

After doing some research, we came to the conclusion that OBS Studio is the best solution if you want to do streaming. OBS is open source, very well maintained and has an intuitive, modern and feature packed interface.
