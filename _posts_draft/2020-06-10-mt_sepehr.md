excerpt: 'The constituent elements of interactive dance are human and computer, which in a human-computer interaction, create a feedback loop, and present the work of art. Considering that matter, each of the opponents in this interaction has their part and space and there is an aesthetic relationship ongoing, defining the quality and amount of each opponent's part and space. In this thesis, this ongoing matter is referred to as the notion of dialogue. To create this sense, the key element that will be discussed is surprise. In order to do that, following a certain design strategy, a practical system will be designed and executed to fortitude the logical argument that is presented in this research. In that performance, by the creative use of the body, space, time, popular art forms (i.e., Hip-Hop music and dance), and with the focus on the subject of sea-level rise, the research argument will be put in practice and further on evaluated. After the evaluation process, in conclusion - despite its limitation - it may be concluded that the use of surprise, will allow the computer to have an active role and possess a significant part in the interaction and convey a sense of dialogue in it.'
