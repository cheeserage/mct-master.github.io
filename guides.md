Being an MCT student can be an overwhelming experience, especially at the beginning. You are required to use several new software tools and online environments from the beginning. Additionally, since you will be a student at both UiO and NTNU, the course registration process can be more complex than usual.

In light of this, we have prepared a collection of [guides](https://github.com/MCT-master/Guides/wiki) featuring step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, general tips and other valuable information on a range of topics designed to make the MCT experience as smooth as possible. We therefore recommend all new and existing students go through each guide and do the necessary preparatory work before the semester starts, or to access these guides when necessary.
